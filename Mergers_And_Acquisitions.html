		<b>What is &#39;Mergers and Acquisitions - M&amp;A&#39;?</b></br>

Mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) is a general term that refers to the consolidation

of companies or assets. While there are several types of transactions classified

under the notion of M&amp;A, a merger means a combination of two companies to

form a new company, while an acquisition is the purchase of one company by

another in which no new company is formed.</br>

		<p ><b>PROCEDURE:</b></br>

Team based game on the concept of mergers and acquisitions where auctioning on companies come

into play. The teams bid and ACQUIRE the companies and then MERGE with the companies owned

by the other teams.</br></br>

The game : <b><i>AUCTIONING</i></b></br>

<b>STAGE 1:</b></br>

The teams will be given few companies and their base value to orient their inquisitive thinking in a

way. The teams then bid on a company and the highest bidder acquire the company he bidded for

and the runner has to pay 25% of his bid to the winning team.</br></br>

<b>STAGE 2:</b></br>

Those who qualify (teams with at least one acquisition) step into the next level where they merge

their companies with the companies owned by the other teams by a mutual understanding. The initial

price of the merged company gets divided between the teams based on the stakes stated.</br>

Winner is decided upon the highest amount of cash that is left with them at the end of the game.</br></br>

<b><i>REGISTRATION FEE: </i></b> minimum of 100/-(teams can register for a greater price to get a greater

bidding amount)</br></br>

<b>PRIZE MONEY:</b> cash prize or conference passes* with a merit certificate.</br>

*The Conference will be on 22<sup>nd</sup> Feb at Institution of Engineers Khairatabad.</br></br>

<b>CERTIFICATION:</b> All the participants will be awarded a participation certificate.</br></br>

<b><i>A DETAILED DESCRIPTION:</i></b>

A team based game to make the participants aware of what m&a is and how it works.</br>

<b>What is 'Mergers And Acquisitions - M&A'?</b></br>

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) is a general term that refers to the consolidation of companies or

assets. While there are several types of transactions classified under the notion of M&A, a merger

means a combination of two companies to form a new company, while an acquisition is the purchase

of one company by another in which no new company is formed.</br>

To add a bit a fun into learning, we ‘merged’ the concept of auctioning and M&A. </br></br>

<b>STAGE 1:(ACQUISITION)</b></br>

So here, the teams are initially provided with a bidding amount depending upon their registration fee.

Then the names of few companies and their base prices are announced. The teams are then

expected to bid on the companies they are capable to buy. The highest bidder owns the company he

bidded for and the runner has to pay 25% of his bid to the winner. At the end of the game, the team

without any bidded company disqualifies.</br></br>

<b>STAGE 2:(MERGER)</b></br>

The teams with atleast one acquired company qualifies to the next level where the teams are given

half an hour to merge their company with the other team on a stake basis and must explain a valid

reason as to why they merged so. Any number of teams can be merged but a reason must be stated.

On the basis of the stakes stated, the base value of the company gets divided between the teams.

Finally, the team with the highest amount left in their pockets win the game.</br></br>

<b><i>Points to remember:</i></b></br>

1. Greater the registration fee, greater the bidding amount you are provided.</br>

2. The runner must pay 25% of his bidded price to the winner.</br>

3. You must acquire a company to qualify to the next stage.</br>

4. At the end of stage-2, a company doesn’t hold any value. You must merge it to earn a value for

the company.</br>

5. More the base value of the company, better it is.</p>
